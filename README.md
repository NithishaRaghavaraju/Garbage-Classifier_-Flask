## 🗑️ Garbage Classification using CNN
A deep learning-based garbage classification model that accurately identifies waste materials into 12 categories:

Battery, Biological, Brown-Glass, Cardboard, Clothes, Green-Glass, Metal, Paper, Plastic, Shoes, Trash, White-Glass

## 📌 Overview
This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of waste materials, aiding in efficient waste management and recycling. By automating garbage sorting, this model helps promote sustainability and reduce environmental pollution.

A Flask web application is also integrated, allowing users to upload images and get real-time classification results.

## 🏗️ Model Architecture
Input: Image of waste material
Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Output: Predicted waste category from the 12 classes
Frameworks: TensorFlow / PyTorch (mention the one you used)
Web Interface: Flask

## 🔍 Dataset
The model is trained on a diverse dataset of waste images, ensuring robust classification across various conditions and perspectives. (Mention dataset source if applicable.)

## 🚀 Features
✅ Classifies waste into 12 categories
✅ Helps automate garbage sorting
✅ Enhances recycling efficiency
